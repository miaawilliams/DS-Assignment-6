# Instead of writing countless loops to find each manager or employee and their whereabouts, recursion just goes down the tree to find the name
# until it returns true and can add in the inserted value. Instead of taking a big problem head on, it simplifies the big problem into smaller, 
# more managable problems to work through. Rather than finding a specific manager or employee throughout the whole tree, it cycles through 
# returning false until it finds the match and returns true. When finding a spot for an employee, you can't just place it anywhere. The 
# biggest problem is placing it with the right manager in either the right or left spot. Unlike previous data structures, I couldn't just 
# use an 'insert' function or an .add and place it in. I had to make sure my code was correctly checking the values in the tree and placing
# it with the corret manager. Trees are better for example problems like these- where a hierarchy system is needed. The values within trees
# depend on each other. Other data structures, like lists, are good for keeping in order or sequence, but are not reliable for looking
# up things quickly, or allowing for a hiearchy system. Along with sets, its values don't depend on one another, however; they are good for 
# faster lookup times.
